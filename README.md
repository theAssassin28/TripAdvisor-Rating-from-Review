# TripAdvisor-Rating-from-Review
### The model was trained with the kaggle dataset with over 20,000 entries with the reviews and ratings. The model uses a vectorizer for the raw input and then the vectorized input is fed into a Random Forest Classifier which provides multi-class classfication to create the ratings. The web-app was built using the Flask framework and deployed using Heroku.
